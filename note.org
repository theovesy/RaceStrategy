#+TITLE: RaceStrategy Notepad

* TODO Convert time into proper laptimes
* TODO Generate Laptime in a better way (normal distribution?) (a lot to think about here !)

* TODO Store data for each car in some sort of race report 


* Ideas:
Use a list of every car object in the race. 
Car has attribute "status" : "pit", "run", "retired", "finished"
Use a finisher list to establish order
